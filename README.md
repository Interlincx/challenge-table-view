## Setup & Running
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start [catalog](https://docs.catalog.style/) - check the docs for more information

## Rules
- Create a component `table-view` in `/src` and add it's path and docs in `/catalog`
- There is already 2 created general purpose components `Select` and `Table` use them to create your component. If you need to edit them it's ok but keep in mind that they will be used in other component for other purposes.
- Write tests for the components you'll create.
- Keep in mind that this component will use different types of data not only the table data provided in this challenge. 
- Follow these [coding style guidelines](https://gist.github.com/davidguttman/9fbdd0e9ee1fb3b33f5cf693195f2edb#code-style)
